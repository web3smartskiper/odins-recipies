    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice thoroughly and parboil it for about 10-15 minutes until it is partially cooked. Drain and set aside.</li>

        <li>Blend the tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and scotch bonnet peppers (if using) into a puree using a blender or food processor.</li>
            
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the blended tomato mixture and cook for about 10-15 minutes or until the liquid has reduced and the sauce is thickened.</li>
            
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper to the pot and stir to combine.</li>
            
        <li>Add the partially cooked rice to the pot and stir to combine with the tomato sauce.</li>
            
        <li>Pour enough water into the pot to cover the rice by about 1/2 inch. Stir gently to combine.</li>
            
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and let the rice simmer until it is fully cooked and has absorbed all the liquid in the pot. Do not stir the rice during the cooking process.</li>            
            
        <li>Once the rice is fully cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for about 5 minutes to allow the steam to escape.</li>
            
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot with your preferred sides.</li>
    </ol>
